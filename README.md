# liri-node-app

## Problem the app is trying to solve
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## Commands to use the APP

   * `node liri.js concert-this "artist name"`

   * `node liri.js spotify-this-song "song name"`

   * `node liri.js movie-this "movie name"`

   * `do-what-it-says`
